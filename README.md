## Hi there 👋

I build performance-sensitive systems in **C++** and **Python** — low-latency pipelines, benchmarking, and observability.
I also do **power-grid automation / digital substation work** (IEC 61850) as an independent contributor on selected projects.

## Current focus (Zetaslate)
- **ZetaForge** — deterministic replay + execution lab (C++20)
- **ZetaLatency** — tail-latency benchmarks (C++20)
- **ZetaOps** — control-room dashboard for runs/latency/attribution (React + Python)
- **ZetaXDP** — kernel-bypass UDP ingest prototype (Linux / AF_XDP)

## Power systems (select work)
- Low Latency IEC 61850 networking.
- Convex optimized Power System OPF
